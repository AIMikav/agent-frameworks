The **Bee Framework** provides two ways to develop agents:  

## 1. Low/No Code UI

### Pros
- Easy to use, with side-by-side editing and testing.

### Cons
1. Limited functionality:
   - Cannot call other agents within the same project.
   - Supports custom tools and can call tools in a custom agent.
2. Error messages are not intuitive:
   - Custom tools must include docstrings in the correct position with proper spacing, or they will result in a `400` error.
3. Examples screenshots:
